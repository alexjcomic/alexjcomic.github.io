      <p>
        Hi Im alex and I am a motivated and passionate junior software engineer
        with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently
        completed a coding bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience in web
        development and built several projects using these technologies. I pride
        my self on my keen eye for detail and a dedication to writing clean and
        efficient code, I am eager to apply these newly obtained skills in a
        professional environment. I have a solid understanding of front-end
        development principles and I'm constantly expanding my knowledge through
        self-study and online resources. Although my experience may seem to be
        limited, I possess excellent problem-solving skills and a willingness to
        learn and grow as a developer. I'm a team player who communicates
        effectively and is always eager to collaborate with others to achieve
        project goals. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to
        meaningful projects and I'm actively seeking an entry-level position or
        internship where I can continue to enhance my skills and make a positive
        impact on the world of software development.
